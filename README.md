# Examining the relationship between social support and mental health outcomes using structural equation modeling in R

# Description
The purpose of this project is to investigate the relationship between social support and mental health outcomes using structural equation modeling (SEM) in R. Social support is an important factor in promoting mental health and well-being, and this project aims to examine the extent to which social support impacts mental health outcomes.

# Dataset
The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) is a publicly available dataset that can be used for this project. It includes data on a variety of factors related to mental health and social support, making it an ideal dataset for this project. The data can be accessed through the following link: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/4652.

# Process
1. Data Preparation: The first step in this project is to load and preprocess the MIDUS dataset using R and the tidyverse package. This involves cleaning the data, selecting relevant variables, and recoding variables as needed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Next, we will explore the data to understand the distribution of variables, correlations between variables, and any patterns or trends in the data. We will use R and the ggplot2 package to create visualizations that help us gain insights into the data.
3. Model Specification: Based on the exploratory data analysis, we will specify a structural equation model that captures the relationship between social support and mental health outcomes. We will use the lavaan package in R to specify and estimate the SEM.
4. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the fit of the SEM using various fit indices, such as the chi-square test, the comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).
5. Interpretation and Visualization: Finally, we will interpret the results of the SEM and visualize the most important relationships and pathways between social support and mental health outcomes.

# Conclusion
This project aims to provide insight into the relationship between social support and mental health outcomes using SEM in R. By identifying the factors that influence mental health outcomes, this research can inform the development of interventions to promote mental health and well-being.

# Documentation
We will document the entire project, including the code, analysis, and results, in a clear and organized manner, including comments and annotations to explain the thought process and reasoning behind each step. This documentation will be published on a public repository on Github for others to view and use.
